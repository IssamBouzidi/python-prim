# PRIM Algorithm

In computer science, `Prim's` (also known as Jarn√≠k's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a `minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph`. This means it finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time, from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection from the tree to another vertex.
